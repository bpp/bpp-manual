Welcome to the home page of the Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography documentation project. If you are new to BPP and just want to install the program and run it on some example datasets you can look at the [Quick Start](https://bpp.github.io/bpp-manual/quickstart/). Comprehensive documentation is available at the [BPP Documentation](https://bpp.github.io/bpp-manual/bpp-4-manual/). Developers interested in contributing to BPP may want to look at the [BPP programmer's guide](https://github.com/bpp/bpp/wiki).

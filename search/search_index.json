The original MSC model (Rannala and Yang 2003) also assumes complete genetic isolation between populations, but more recent implementations allow gene flow between species (either continuous migration or episodic introgression); the MSC-I model implemented in BPP allows episodic introgression Flouri et al 2020 and the IM model allows continuous migration (see Introgression and Migration Models and Isolation With Migration Models). The default model assumes a strict molecular clock (constant substitution rates among lineages) and relaxed-clocks (with substitution rates varying among lineages) are implemented through variable clock models (see Substitution Models).</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#nuclear-genomic-data","title":"Nuclear genomic data","text":"<p>Ideal data for analysis using the BPP program are loosely-linked short genomic segments. Such data are likely to satisfy the model assumptions because intra-locus recombination is rare for short segments (500 to 1000bp) and distantly spaced segments undergo frequent recombination and thus have nearly independent histories. Genealogical trees are assumed to be a product of neutral evolution (not influenced by natural selection). However, protein-coding gene sequences appear to be useable in BPP analyses since most proteins are performing similar functions in closely related species and the main effect of purifying selection on nonsynonymous mutations is a reduction of the neutral mutation rate (Shi and Yang 2018; Thawornwattana et al 2018).  It is a good idea to separate the noncoding and coding regions of the genome into two datasets.</p> <p>The program allows the option of either a constant rate (strict molecular clock) or variable rates of substitution (relaxed molecular clocks) among lineages. Different substitution models are available, with the most complex (parameter rich) being the General Time-Reversible (GTR) model and the simplest the Jukes-Cantor (JC69) mutation model. All the models correct for multiple hits at individual sites (see Substitution Models).  The use of the JC69 model and the strict molecular clock model should be limited to closely related species with sequence divergence not much higher than 10%. Sequences from distantly related species should be analyzed using a GTR substitution model in combination with one of the relaxed clock models (see Among-species rate variation. Models allowing substitution rate variation among sites  (see Among-site rate variation) and among loci (see Among-locus rate variation)are also implemented in BPP (see Models of Substitution Rate Variation). </p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#mitochondrial-data","title":"Mitochondrial data","text":"<p>The MSC model accommodates genealogical heterogeneity across the genome. Thus, different regions of the autosomal genome may have different gene tree topologies and branch lengths (coalescent times). While the mutational process may also vary along the genome, this heterogeneity is believed to be much less important. Thus multiple genes from the mitochondrial genome, which in most species does not undergo recombination, should be treated as one 'locus' in the MSC-based analysis. The mitochondrial genome often has a mutation rate that differs from the nuclear genome, as well as a different effective population size from that of autosomes. While the model of locus-rate variation (option variable <code>locusrate</code>) and the heredity scalar (option variable <code>heredity</code>) are designed to deal with this, it may be prudent to analyze the loci from the nuclear genome separately from the single mitochondrial locus.</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#identical-sequences-and-phylogenetic-signal","title":"Identical sequences and phylogenetic signal","text":"<p>The model implemented in BPP assumes that the sequences represent random samples from the different species.

In the phylip/paml format the first line of the entry for each locus contains two numbers specifying the number of sequences and the number of sites, respectively, that are present at the locus. A sequence name must precede each sequence entry and be separated from it by either a line break or two or more spaces. Each sequence name must contain an individual ID, which is unique among the sequences listed for a given locus, preceded by a caret <code>^</code> symbol. For example, the sequence name <code>GI01234567^Specimen1</code> has the individual ID <code>Specimen1</code>.

The sequences may be in interleaved format.</p> <p>DNA bases can be specified using either upper or lower case letters, missing data can be specified using a <code>?</code> symbol, and IUPAC ambiguity codes may be used. The interpretation of an ambiguity code (as either an uncertain base or a diploid genotype) depends on whether the data are specified as phased in the control file. By default (control file variable <code>cleandata = 0</code>, see Control File), alignment gaps and ambiguity nucleotides are used in the likelihood calculation, with gaps treated as question marks  (see Yang 2014 pp.\u00a0111-112).  If <code>cleandata = 1</code>, all columns with gaps or ambiguity characters are removed before analysis.

For example, the sequence name <code>GI01234567^Specimen1</code> has the individual ID <code>Specimen1</code>. An Imap file maps the individual IDs (specimens) to their species/populations. For example, the following Imap file maps <code>Specimen1</code> to species A, <code>Specimen4</code> to species B, and so on. <pre><code>    Specimen1   A\n    Specimen2   A\n    Specimen3   A\n    Specimen4   B\n    Specimen5   C\n    Specimen6   C\n</code></pre> See also the map files <code>frogs.Imap.txt</code> and <code>Rokas2003-5species-Imap.txt</code> in the <code>examples</code> subdirectory. The MSC model implemented in BPP infers the relationships among species/populations not individuals and so it uses only the population ID for a sequence (such as A, B, ... in the example), and does not use the individual ID. Also when BPP reads the sequence names, it use the individual ID to retrieve the species ID for each sequence but then ignores the sequence name. One motivation for the use of the Imap file and this two-layer design is that one may wish to analyze the same sequence data with different population/species assignments of individual IDs.

Topological constraints on species trees can only be specified for analyses A01 (species tree inference with a fixed species delimitation) and A11 (joint species tree inference and species delimitation). See Methods of Analysis for a detailed description of the A01 and A11 methods of analysis. Note that species trees are always rooted in BPP, whether you use the clock or relaxed clock. The control variable <code>constraintfile</code> in the control file has the format <pre><code>    constraintfile = constraints.txt\n</code></pre> Inside the constraint file, three keywords are allowed: <code>define</code>, <code>constraint</code>, and <code>outgroup</code>. The <code>define</code> keyword is used to assign a name or alias to a clade, <code>constraint</code> defines a clade or subtree, and <code>outgroup</code> means that species not on the list (the ingroup species) form a clade. <pre><code>    define g1 as (G,H);\n    # identical to constraint (D,E,F,(G,H));\n    constraint (D,E,F,g1);   \n    outgroup A,B,C;\n    constraint (A,B);\n</code></pre> Either the equal sign (=) or spaces can be used to separate the keyword from the specified value. In the example above, there are eight species in the dataset: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Line 1 defines an alias <code>g1</code> for clade (G,H), which may be used in subsequent <code>define</code> or <code>constraint</code> statements. Line 3 specifies A, B, C as the outgroups; this is interpreted to mean that species not on the list, (that is, D, E, F, G and H) form a clade. Since this information is already in line 2, line 3 has no effect in this case.</p> <p>The modifier keyword <code>NOT</code> (case-insensitive) can be used with <code>define</code> to instead specify the complement of the species on the list. Suppose in the data we have 10 species of ratites (flightless birds), and two outgroup species, chicken and ostrich. You can specify the constraint as follows: <pre><code>    define ratites as NOT (chicken, ostrich);\n    constraint = (chicken, (ostrich, ratites));\n</code></pre> Note that BPP interprets <code>outgroup</code> to mean that all species not on the list form a clade. In theory the <code>outgroup</code> keyword is unnecessary because you can always achieve the same thing by using <code>define</code> (especially with the <code>NOT</code> option) and <code>constraint</code>. However <code>outgroup</code> may be more convenient or explicit in some situations. If there are four species (A,B,C,D), <pre><code>    outgroup = B,C,D;\n</code></pre> achieves nothing since all the 15 rooted species trees are allowed, whereas <pre><code>    outgroup = C,D;\n</code></pre> means (A,B) form a clade so that 3 rooted species trees are allowed. Finally if multiple compatible constraints are specified, BPP merges them into one so that <pre><code>    constraint (E,F,G,H);\n    constraint (F,G,H);\n    constraint (G,H);\n</code></pre> is equivalent to <pre><code>    constraint (E,(F,(G,H)));\n</code></pre> If any two constraints are in conflict, BPP will abort with an error message.

When using tip-dating, each sample has an associated sample age.  The <code>datefile</code> assigns an age to the sample using the individual ID tag. The dates are in units before time present, so larger numbers are older. Any desired time units (e.g. years, thousands of year, etc) can be used so long as the mutation rate prior is on the same time scale (e.g. expected substitutions per year, expected substitutions per thousand years). For example, the following date file assigns <code>specimen1</code> an age 500, <code>specimen2</code> an age of 10000.

The default control file name is <code>bpp.ctl</code>. Lines beginning with <code>*</code> or <code>#</code> are comments and are ignored by the program. Most often the order of the lines is unimportant, but there are exceptions (as explained below). Each non-commented line of the control file contains a variable name and an assignment of one or more values to the variable. The general syntax of a line in the control file is: <pre><code>    variable = value\n</code></pre> where <code>variable</code> is the name of a valid variable and <code>value</code> is a list of one or more permissible values for the variable. Most variable assignments follow this format --- the exceptions are described later. BPP has complicated dependencies among variables, both in terms of whether the variable needs to be defined (or has a default value when undefined) and what its permissible values are.

Column\u00a05 lists indexes of variables that either are influenced by the variable (the notation -&gt;[c,d] indicates that the variable influences variables c and d) or variables that influence the variable (the notation &lt;-[a] indicates that variable a influences the variable).

The missing data tokens <code>N-?</code> are allowed and are all treated as ?, but other ambiguity characters (<code>HBVD</code>) are not allowed.</p> <p>For phasing, each sequence is expanded/resolved into two sequences, and the program averages over possible phase resolutions according to the approach of @Gronau2011. For example, a sequence <code>R...Y</code> with two heterozygous sites, <code>R</code> (meaning <code>A/G</code>) and <code>Y</code> (meaning <code>C/T</code>), has two possible phase resolutions:</p> <ol> <li> <p><code>A...T</code> and <code>G...C</code></p> </li> <li> <p><code>A...C</code> and <code>G...T</code></p> </li> </ol> <p>A sequence with no heterozygous sites will be phased/resolved into two identical sequences. The MSC model effectively averages over different phase resolutions of the heterozygous sites in performing the likelihood calculation. The option may increase memory usage and CPU time considerably if many sequences exist with many heterozygote sites at a locus.

This is the strategy used by Yang 2002, with the relative rates estimated by the distance to an outgroup species. The relative locus rates are listed in the file: there should be as many numbers in the file, separately by spaces or line returns, as the number of loci (nloci). The program re-scales those rates so that the average across all loci is 1 and then use those relative rates as fixed constants.

Note that \\(\\alpha_{\\nu_i}\\) is inversely related to the variance of \\(\\nu_i\\): use small values of \\(\\alpha_{\\nu_i}\\) (2, 1, or 0.5) if you believe that \\(\\nu_i\\) varies among loci (meaning that the clock nearly holds at some loci but is seriously violated at others).</p> <p>As another example, the specification (<code>clock = 2 10.0 100.0 5.0 dir LN</code>) means that \\(\\bar\\nu\\) is assigned a gamma prior \\(G(10.0, 100.0)\\), and then the sum \\(L\\bar\\nu\\) is partitioned into \\(\\nu_i\\) (for \\(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, L\\)) according to the Dirichlet distribution (<code>prior = dir</code>) with concentration parameter \\(\\alpha_{\\nu_i} = 5.0\\). Again large \\(\\alpha_{\\nu_i}\\) means the same extent of clock violation at different loci.</p> <p>Given the locus rate \\(\\mu_i\\) (specified using the <code>locusrate</code> variable) and the variance \\(\\nu_i\\) (specified using the <code>clock</code> variable) for locus \\(i\\), the different lineages may have different rates at the locus, and those rates are independent among loci. If distribution specified is <code>G</code> (for gamma), the rate for species-tree branch \\(j\\) at locus \\(i\\) has the following gamma distribution</p> <p>\\(r_{ij} | \\mu_i, \\nu_i \\sim \\mathrm{G}(\\mu_i^2/\\nu_i, \\mu_i/\\nu_i)\\).</p> <p>This has mean \\(\\mu_i\\) and variance \\(\\nu_i\\). Alternatively if distribution = <code>LN</code> (for log-normal), the rate for species-tree branch \\(j\\) at locus \\(i\\) has the following the log-normal distribution</p> <p>\\(r_{ij} | \\mu_i, \\nu_i \\sim \\mathrm{LN}(\\mu_i, \\nu_i)\\),</p> <p>where \\(\\mu_i\\) is the mean of the LN distribution and \\(\\nu_i\\) is the variance parameter of the lognormal. Note that the rate-drift model specifies rates for branches on the species tree (rather than on the gene tree) for each locus, and gene-tree branches residing in the same population or species have the same rate. For example, if all sequences at a locus are from the same species and all coalescent events occur in that species (before reaching an ancestral species), all branches on the gene tree will have the same rate even if the relaxed-clock model allows rates among species. In contrast, if a gene-tree branch passes several species or populations, the different segments of the branch will have different rates. The branch length on the gene tree is calculated by summing up the lengths of those segments (with the length of each segment being the product of the rate and the time duration for the segment).</p> <p>The option <code>clock = 3</code> is similar to clock 2 but specifies the autocorrelated-rates model. <code>clock = 3</code> with the log-normal distribution (LN) specifies the geometric Brownian motion model of Rannala and Yang 2007. This assigns a rate to each species-tree branch, that is, to the mid-point of the branch. Given the rate at the species-tree root (\\(\\mu_i\\) at locus \\(i\\)), the rates for the two branches around the root are specified. Then given the rate for each ancestral branch, the rates for its two daughter branches are specified, by integrating over the rate at the internal node that is ancestral to the daughter branches. See figure 1 and equations 3-8 in Rannala and Yang 2007. The rates for all species-tree branches are thus assigned through a pre-order tree traversal, starting from the root moving to the tips, until all branches are visited. If <code>clock = 3</code> is specified with the gamma distribution (option <code>G</code>), the model works as follows, using a similar pre-order tree traversal. First the two branches at the species-tree root have the gamma distribution with mean \\(\\mu_i\\) and variance \\(\\nu_i\\). Then given the rate for each ancestral branch, the rates for its two daughter branches are specified as independent gamma variables with the mean to be the rate of the parental branch and with the variance to be \\(\\nu_i\\). Clock 3 is currently implemented for the MSC model only and is unavailable under the MSC-I model.</p> <p>Note that a larger variance \\(\\nu_i\\) implies a more serious violation of the molecular clock at locus \\(i\\). Also note that \\(\\nu_i\\) will be similar to \\(\\bar\\nu\\), especially if \\(\\alpha_{\\nu_i}\\) is large, and \\(\\bar\\nu\\) has prior mean \\(\\alpha_{\\bar{\\nu}} / \\beta_{\\bar{\\nu}}\\). If \\(\\alpha_{\\bar{\\nu}} = 10\\) and \\(\\beta_{\\bar{\\nu}} = 100\\), the prior mean will be 0.1. Thus, for the log-normal model \\(\\nu = 0.5\\) represents a serious violation of the clock while \\(\\nu &lt; 0.1\\) represents only a slight violation.

If inheritance scalars are estimated, the parameters of the prior also must be specified.

DEFAULT <code>0</code> COMMENTS <code>heredity = 0</code> is the default and constrains \\(\\theta\\) to be equal across loci. <code>heredity = 1</code> or <code>2</code> specifies two models that allow \\(\\theta\\) to vary among loci, which may be useful for analyses combining data from autosomal loci, loci on sex chromosomes, and/or mitochondrial loci. Such mixed data, may be expected to have proportional differences in effective population sizes among loci so that inheritance scalars Hey and Nielsen 2004 should be applied. For example, in diploid sexual organisms with strict maternal inheritance of mtDNA we expect the effective population size of a mitochondrial locus to be \\(1/4\\) that of a nuclear locus. Other factors such as natural selection may also cause \\(\\theta\\) to deviate from the neutral expectation even among autosomal loci. BPP implements two options for allowing such variations. The first option (<code>heredity = 1</code>) specifies that locus-specific inheritance scalars \\(s_i\\) be estimated, using a Gamma prior with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) specified by the user.

The MCMC then generates the posterior distribution of \\(s_i\\) for each locus.

Because BPP uses pseudorandom numbers to drive a stochastic algorithm for inference the results will vary between analyses initiated with different seeds, but will be identical if the same seed is used (because pseudorandom numbers are generated using a deterministic algorithm started with the value of seed). Setting <code>seed = -1</code> specifies that BPP use the clock on the computer to generate a seed. With this setting, every run of the program will automatically be started with a different seed. The seed that was used for a run is stored in a file generated by the program called SeedUsed. <pre><code>    seqfile = frogs.txt\n    Imapfile = frogs.Imap.txt\n    jobname = out\n</code></pre> These lines specify the names of the files used to run the program and summarize the output. The program will assume that all these files are located in the current working directory since no path is specified. The line <code>seqfile = frogs.txt</code> specifies that the sequence data are in the file named <code>frogs.txt</code>. See Sequence File for a  description of the sequence data file format. The line <code>Imapfile = frogs.Imap.txt</code> specifies that the map file is named <code>frogs.Imap.txt</code>. See Imap File for a description of the map file format. The line <code>jobname = out</code> specifies that the program output and mcmc samples are printed to files named <code>out.txt</code> and <code>out.mcmc.txt</code>, respectively. The format of the output file depends on the type of analysis being performed and is described in Methods of Analysis. <pre><code>    # fixed species tree\n    speciesdelimitation = 0 \n    speciestree = 0\n</code></pre> The line <code>speciesdelimitation = 0</code> specifies that the number of species is fixed (not delimited) and the line <code>speciestree = 0</code> specifies that the species phylogeny (topology) is fixed (not estimated). This combination specifies an analysis of type A00, which is parameter estimation under a MSC using multiple-loci and multiple-species data on a fixed species tree (Rannala and Yang 2003; Burgess and Yang 2008). Analysis A00 is described in detail in A00: Demography and Divergence Time Estimation. <pre><code>    species&amp;tree = 4  K  C  L  H\n                   9  7 14  2\n                   (((K, C), L), H);\n</code></pre> The line <code>species&amp;tree = 4 K C L H</code> specifies the number of species/populations and their names. This example specifies 4 species in the data, which are K, C, L and H. The next line <code>9 7 14 2</code> specifies the maximum number of sequences at any locus for each species/population (in the same order as the species listing on the previous line). This example specifies a maximum of 9 sequences for K, 7 for C, 14 for L and 2 for H. The program interprets these numbers as follows. First, if the number of sequences for a species is 2 or greater, \\(\\theta\\) for that species will be a parameter estimated by the program. Second, the sum of the numbers of sequences over all species specifies the maximum number of sequences at a locus. However, specifying 2 sequences for a species when there are actually 10 sequences for that species at some loci in the data file has no harmful effects. Note that if there are \\(s\\) species in the species tree, the model will minimally contain the following parameters: \\(s \u2013 1\\) species divergence times (\\(\\tau\\)s) and \\(s \u2013 1\\) ancestral species \\(\\theta\\)s. A \\(\\theta\\) parameter will also exist for each contemporary species with at least two sequences present at some locus. If the data are for a single species/population, the model will contain one parameter only, \\(\\theta\\) for that species.</p> <p>The line <code>(((K, C), L), H);</code> specifies the (fixed) species tree in Newick format ending with a semicolon (;). This example specifies a tree with no introgression (the MSC model). Specification of the MSC-I model with introgression is different (see Introgression and Migration Models for a description of the MSC-I model). The Newick and extended Newick formats for specifying phylogenetic trees are described in Introgression and Migration Models and a good overview is found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format. <pre><code>    # sequence data are unphased for all 4 populations\n    phase =   1  1  1  1\n</code></pre> The <code>phase</code> variable is specified using a boolean (0/1) indicator variable for each species/population, with 0 (the default) specifying that sequences from that species are fully phased haplotypes and 1 specifying they are unphased diploid sequences. If this line is omitted, all sequences are assumed to be fully phased (that is, value 0 for all species). The program does not allow some sequences from a species to be phased while other sequences from that same species are unphased. If the variable is 1, each sequence from that species is treated as an unphased diploid sequence, with heterozygous sites represented using ambiguity characters <code>YRMKSW</code>. The chararcters <code>N</code>, <code>-</code> and <code>?</code> are allowed in the sequence file and are all treated as <code>?</code>, but other ambiguities (HBVD) are not allowed. Each sequence is then expanded/resolved into two sequences, and the program averages over all the possible phase resolutions according to the approach of Gronau et al 2011. For example a sequence with two heterozygous sites R and Y is resolved into two possible haplotypes: (i) A...T and G...C, and (ii) A...C and G...T. Note that this option forces a sequence with no heterozygote sites to be phased/resolved into two identical sequences.</p> <p>The MSC model averages over different phase resolutions of the heterozygote sites in the likelihood calculation. This option may increase the memory usage and CPU time considerably if there are many sequences with many heterozygote sites at one locus. The simulation program MCcoal has been modified to simulate diploid unphased data as well. This allows one to use simulations to examine the difference between the analysis of the full data and the unphased data. If the phase flag for a species is 0, all sequences from that species are treated as resolved haplotype sequences, and ambiguities are interpreted in the usual way (for example, Y means one nucleotide that is either T or C). <pre><code>    # 0: no data (prior); 1:seq like\n    usedata = 1  \n</code></pre> The line <code>usedata = 1</code> specifies that the likelihood is used in the MCMC run to generate the posterior distribution of parameters. Setting this to 0 allows one to run the MCMC without sequence data to generate the prior (mostly used for debugging). <pre><code>    # number of data sets in seqfile\n    nloci = 5  \n</code></pre> The line <code>nloci = 5</code> specifies the number of loci (alignments) to be 5. There may be more loci in the sequence data file than is specified here. For example, if 200 loci exist in the sequence data file and you specify <code>nloci = 2</code> in the control file, BPP will read the first two loci only. <pre><code>    # remove sites with ambiguity data (1:yes, 0:no)?\n    cleandata = 0    \n</code></pre> The line <code>cleandata = 0</code> specifies that columns in the alignment which have gaps or ambiguity characters are retained and used in the likelihood calculation. Setting <code>cleandata = 1</code> instead specifies that such data are removed prior to analysis. <pre><code>    # invgamma(a, b) for theta\n    thetaprior = invgamma 3 0.004 E  \n</code></pre> The line <code>thetaprior = 3 0.004 E</code> specifies the inverse-gamma prior IG(\\(\\alpha, \\beta\\)) for the \\(\\theta\\) parameters, with the mean to be \\(\\beta/(\\alpha-1)\\). In the example, the mean is \\(0.004/(3 \u2013 1) = 0.002\\) (two substitutions per kb on average) and the option E specifies that the program analytically integrates over \\(\\theta\\)s. Note that all \\(\\theta\\) parameters in the MSC model (for both modern species and extinct ancestral species) are assigned the inverse-gamma prior with the same parameters.</p> <p>Analytical integration of \\(\\theta\\) and the inverse gamma prior The inverse-gamma is a conjugate prior for \\(\\theta\\) (Hey and Nielsen 2007) which means that both the prior and the posterior of \\(\\theta\\) will be inverse-gamma. Use of the conjugate priors allows the \\(\\theta\\) parameters to be integrated out analytically, and thus the dimension of the parameter space is reduced. This typically leads to improved mixing of the MCMC. However, with this option, the posterior of the \\(\\theta\\) parameters will not be produced. To estimate the \\(\\theta\\) parameters, add the letter e (or E) on the line, as follows <pre><code>    thetaprior = invgamma 3 0.002 e\n</code></pre> Whether \\(\\theta\\)s are integrated out or estimated, other results (such as the posterior of the \\(\\theta\\) parameters or the posterior probability of species trees or species-delimitation models) should be identical. A useful strategy may be to run the A01, A10, and A11 analyses without estimating the \\(\\theta\\) parameters, and after the MAP model (the best species tree or the best species delimitation model) is identified, run the A00 analysis with the model fixed to estimate all parameters.</p> <p>Some notes about the inverse-gamma distribution. Since BPP3.4, both the \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) parameters are assigned the inverse gamma priors rather than the gamma priors in version 3.3 or earlier. One difference is that the gamma is light-tailed while the inverse-gamma is heavy-tailed, so that the inverse-gamma may be less influential than the gamma if your prior mean is much too small. The inverse-gamma distribution IG(\\(\\alpha, \\beta\\)) has mean \\(m = \\alpha/(\\beta-1)\\) if \\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\) and variance \\(s^2 = \\beta^2/[(\\alpha-1)^2(\\alpha-2)]\\) if \\(\\alpha &gt; 2\\), while the coefficient of variation is \\(s/m = \\sqrt{1/(\\alpha-2)}\\). If little information is available about the parameters, you can use \\(\\alpha = 3\\) for a diffuse prior and then adjust the \\(\\beta\\) so that the mean looks reasonable. For example, for the human species, \\(\\theta_H \\approx 0.0006\\), which means that two random sequences from the human population are different at \u00a00.06% of sites, less than 1 difference per kb. A sensible diffuse prior is then <code>thetaprior = 3 0.002</code>, with mean \\(0.002/(3 \u2013 1) = 0.001\\). <pre><code>    # invgamma(a, b) for root tau &amp; Dirichlet(a) for other tau's\n    tauprior = invgamma 3 0.002    \n</code></pre> The line <code>tauprior = 3 0.002</code> specifies the inverse-gamma prior IG(\\(\\alpha, \\beta\\)) for \\(\\tau_0\\), the divergence time parameter for the root in the species tree. Other divergence times are generated from the uniform Dirichlet distribution (Yang and Rannala 2010, eq.2). In the example, the mean is \\(0.002/(3 \u2013 1) = 0.001\\) (which means 0.1% average sequence divergence between the root of the species tree and the present time). If the mutation rate is \\(10^{\u20139}\\) mutations/site/year, this distance will translate to a divergence time of 1\u00a0MY. <pre><code>    # finetune: auto-adjust step lengths during burnin\n    finetune = 1  \n</code></pre> The line <code>finetune = 1</code> enables automatic optimization of step lengths during burnin. This is the recommended setting. The program will adjust step lengths to achieve good mixing. If auto-tuning is enabled, burnin must be &gt; 200.

When using this option be careful not to overwrite files that you intended to keep. The <code>print = -1</code> option is useful for combining MCMC samples from multiple runs to produce the posterior summary. Suppose you run the same analysis 3 times in different directories -- you can merge the out.mcmc.txt files from the three runs into one file and run the program using the <code>print = -1</code> option to summarize the posterior for the combined sample. Note that if you forced one or more of the jobs to terminate (using the Unix kill command for example) the last line of each out.mcmc.txt file may incomplete.

Fundamental to all molecular phylogeographic analyses is the model of the nucleotide or amino acid substitution process itself. DNA substitution models can accomodate different rates of substitution between nucleotides due to factors such as transition versus transversion bias and unequal stationary nucleotide frequencies. BPP allows the use of many different DNA base substitution and amino acid substitution models. For DNA sequences, the models range from a simple Jukes-Cantor model (computationally efficient) to a sophisticated General Time-Reversible (GTR) model (computationally expensive but more realistic). For closely related species the Jukes-Cantor model is often adequate, while the GTR often performs better for more distantly related species. The remaining DNA substitution models (K80, F81, HKY, T92, TN93, and F84) are all special cases (submodels) of the GTR model and are of intermediate complexity, usually having one or two free parameters (see Yang 2014). Many fixed substitution matrix models (no free parameters) for modeling substitutions among amino acid sequences are also available.</p> <p>Another factor to consider is variation in overall (or average) substitution rates. The overall rate of substitution can vary in multiple ways and, based on empirical evidence, this type of variation is one of the most important factors to accommodate during phylogeographic inference. There are 3 distinct types of substitution rate variation that can be accommodated using the models implemented in BPP: rate variation among sites, rate variation among loci, and rate variation among species (or populations). Substitution rate variation among sites, or among loci, is a common pattern and is likely due to the pervasive effects of negative (purifying) selection. Variation of substitution rates among species (or populations) is more often observed among distantly related species and may reflect the effects of differential selection, evolution of DNA repair mechanisms, or other factors.</p> <p>This Chapter briefly describes the models of DNA substitution, and of substitution rate variation, implemented in BPP, the parameters and priors associated with these models, and how to specify the different models in the BPP control file.</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#dna-substitution-models","title":"DNA Substitution Models","text":""},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#jukes-cantor-model","title":"Jukes-Cantor model","text":"<p>One of the earliest and simplest models of DNA substitution, the Jukes-Cantor model, assumes that all possible changes between the 4 nucleotides have equal rates and thus the stationary frequencies of bases are \\(1/4\\) each.

However, for closely related sequences (with few multiple substitutions) it often performs as well as more sophisticated models while incurring much less computational expense.

The GTR model accommodates factors such as transition-transversion bias and should be used when sequences are more divergent (distantly related species). The control file specification of the GTR model is: <pre><code>    model = GTR\n</code></pre> Note that if the GTR model is used, two other variables may be specified in the control file: <code>Qrates</code> and <code>basefreqs</code>. The <code>Qrates</code> variable specifies whether the exchangeability parameters of the GTR model are fixed or variable as well as either their fixed values, or prior mean values, respectively. The control file specification is: <pre><code>    Qrates = B a b c d e f\n</code></pre> The variable <code>B</code> is either 0 (variable exchangeability parameters) or 1 (fixed exchangeability parameters). The variables <code>a b c d e f</code> are positive numbers specifying the exchangeability parameters for TC, TA, TG, CA, CG and AG substitutions respectively (see Yang 1994). Note that TC is the rate of either T-&gt;C or C-&gt;T substitutions. Note that only the relative rates matter because the rate matrix is scaled to have an overall average substitution rate of 1. Thus, for the model of fixed rates if x is any positive number a b c d e f and xa xb xc xd xe xf are equivalent specifications. An example with fixed rates is as follows: <pre><code>    Qrates = 1  2 1 1 1 1 2\n</code></pre> which specifies \\(a=2,b=c=d=e=1,f=2\\) so that the transition rate is twice as high as the transversion rate, corresponding to a K80 or HKY model.

The control file specification is: <pre><code>    basefreqs = B T C A G\n</code></pre> where B is either 0 (variable base frequencies) or 1 (fixed base frequencies) and T C A and G are numbers specifying the frequencies of bases T, C, A and G, respectively. An example with fixed base frequencies is as follows: <pre><code>    basefreqs = 1  0.1 0.2 0.2 0.5\n</code></pre> In most cases, users will want to use the variable base frequencies setting which specifies that the posterior distribution of base frequencies is estimated from the data.

In contrast, if a gene-tree branch passes several species or populations, the different segments of the branch will have different rates.

In models A, B1, and C, the introgression event is from the source branch RA to the target branch TC, with a new introgression branch SH created.  The introgression probability (\\(\\varphi = 0.1\\)) is assigned to the newly added introgression branch (SH) while \\(1 \u2013 \\varphi\\) is assigned to the other parent branch (TH).  Models A, B1, and C are distinguished by using the keyword <code>tau</code> (which means the same as <code>tau-parent</code> in the Newick notation of the MSC-I model). Model A assumes that the two parental species S and T of the hybridization node H have distinct ages from H, with \\(\\tau_S &gt; \\tau_H\\) and \\(\\tau_T &gt; \\tau_H\\).  Thus we have <code>hybridization R A, T C as S H tau=yes, yes phi=0.10</code>: the first <code>yes</code> means that parental node S on the source branch RA has a distinct tau from node H and that the second <code>yes</code> means that parental node T on the target branch TC has a distinct tau from node H.  Note that there are often multiple ways of specifying the same MSC-I model and here you can specify model A by starting with the binary tree <code>((A, C), B)</code> and adding branch TH as a introgression event.  Model A might appear to be nonsensical biologically since only contemporary species can exchange migrants.  Nevertheless, model A may be used to represent introgressions from a ghost species not sampled in the sequence dataset.  Suppose at time \\(\\tau_S\\) a speciation event generated two species SA and SH, and at \\(\\tau_H\\), species SH contributed migrants into species THC, but species SH has since become extinct or is otherwise not sampled in the data.  This scenario matches model A. Model B1 assumes \\(\\tau_S = \\tau_H\\) and \\(\\tau_T &gt; \\tau_H\\) so there is no new tau for parent S of the hybridization node H, and there is a new tau for parent T.  Thus we have <code>tau=no, yes</code>.  Model B2 works similarly.  In model C, none of parents S and T has a distinct age from H, so we have <code>tau=no, no</code>.  One interpretation is that species C is a hybrid species. In model D for the bidirectional introgression (BDI) model, there is no distinction of source and target branches.

Briefly, BPP is capable of analyzing sequence data using 4 distinct phylogeographical models. The 4 models are determined by the combinations of two possible settings for each of the two Boolean control file variables <code>speciesdelimitation</code> (0 = no species delimitation, 1 = species delimitation) and <code>speciestree</code> (0 = fixed species tree, 1 = inferred species tree). Therefore, analysis A00 infers the biogeographical parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) on a fixed (user specified) tree with a fixed (delimited) number of species/populations as described in (Rannala and Yang 2003. Analysis A10 delimits the number of species and infers biogeographical parameters using a fixed species tree (guide tree) as described in Yang and Rannala 2010. Analysis A01 infers the species tree and biogeographical parameters using a fixed number of species (delimitation) as described in Rannala and Yang 2017. Analysis A11 jointly infers the species tree, species delimitation and biogeographical parameters as described in Yang and Rannala 2014.  Under Model A00 it is also possible to include a model of either instantaneous introgression or ongoing gene flow -- examples of such analyses are given in Introgression and Migration Models. For each of these 4 major types of analyses the control file specifications will differ as well as the form of output printed to the screen and output files. Therefore, we will include two subsections in our discussion of each analysis method: input and output. Here we only consider the control file variables specific to the methods of analysis under consideration. For a general discussion of other control file variables see the example control file discussed in Control File. Note that for most analyses the output printed to screen during the run and that printed to the specified output file will be identical.</p> <p>It is important to note that only analysis A00 applies within-model inference. There is one specified model in that case (the MSC with a fixed species tree) and the parameters are well defined, with the objective being to estimate those parameters. In contrast, analyses A01, A10, and A11 all apply trans-model inference. They move between different models, and the main objective is to calculate the posterior probabilities of the models. Each is an instance of the MSC model, but the species delimitation (the number and nature of the species) and/or the species phylogeny may differ between models. In analyses A01, A10, and A11, the prior specified using control file variable <code>thetaprior</code> applies to all \\(\\theta\\) parameters in all models. Similarly, all MSC models specifying two or more delimited species have a parameter \\(\\tau_0\\) (the divergence time of the root), and these parameters (for different models) are assigned the same prior, specified by the <code>tauprior</code> control file variable.</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#a00-demography-and-divergence-time-estimation","title":"A00: Demography and Divergence Time Estimation","text":"<p>Analysis A00<code>(speciesdelimitation = 0, speciestree = 0)</code>, requires a user-specified species tree topology, given by variable <code>species&amp;tree</code> in the control file, and infers the \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) parameters on this fixed tree. The theory underlying estimation of species divergence times and population sizes (\\(\\tau\\)s and \\(\\theta\\)s) under the MSC model when the species phylogeny is given is described in (Rannala and Yang 2003. Note that if there are \\(s\\) species in the species tree, the model will minimally contain the following parameters: \\(s \u2013 1\\) species divergence times (\\(\\tau\\)s) and \\(s \u2013 1\\) ancestral species \\(\\theta\\)s. A \\(\\theta\\) parameter will also exist for each contemporary species with at least two sequences present at some locus. If the data are for a single species/population, the model will contain one parameter only, \\(\\theta\\) for that species. If there is only one species, the MSC model becomes the single-population Kingman coalescent. We will provide examples of both a single population analysis (using the control file <code>yu2001.bpp.ctl</code>) and a multi-species analysis (using the control file <code>A00.bpp.ctl</code>).</p> <p>How many \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) parameters exist? The number of parameters that BPP includes in the MSC or MSC-I/MSC-M models depends on the data configuration. The program always includes \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) parameters for each internal node (ancestral species) on the species tree, but includes a \\(\\theta\\) for an extant species (tip) if and only if that species has at least 2 sequences at some loci. If two or more sequences for a species are specified in the control file but there are at most 0 or 1 sequence per locus for that species in the sequence data file, \\(\\theta\\) for that species will not be identifiable or estimable. In that case, the posterior for the parameter will be the prior. Nevertheless, other results (such as the posterior distribution for other parameters or posterior probabilities for species trees and species delimitations) will still be correct. The same applies to other more complex cases of missing data and parameter non-identifiability. As an example, suppose the species tree and the numbers of sequences (for species A, B, C and D from left to right) for two kinds of loci are as follows:</p> <p>((A,B), (C,D)) locus configuration 1: 1 1 0 0 locus configuration 2: 2 0 0 1</p> <p>In this case, \\(\\theta_A\\), \\(\\theta_{AB}\\), \\(\\theta_{ABCD}\\), \\(\\tau_{AB}\\), and \\(\\tau_{ABCD}\\) are identifiable while \\(\\theta_B\\), \\(\\theta_C\\), \\(\\theta_D\\), \\(\\theta_{CD}\\) and \\(\\tau_{CD}\\) are not.

The <code>Prgs</code> (progress) column will appear in all analyses and indicates the percentage of the MCMC iterations that have been completed. If this number is negative it indicates that the program is still running the burn-in iterations. For example, <code>-15%</code> means that 15 percent of the burn-in iterations remain to be completed. The next 6 columns are the current acceptance proportions for different parameter proposals in the MCMC.

The <code>tau</code> column (the \\(\\tau\\) proposal acceptance proportion) is zero; this is expected because there are no species divergence times (\\(\\tau\\)s) in the model when only a single species exists. The column labeled <code>theta1</code> gives the current average (mean) value of theta in the MCMC. The final columns are the log probability of the coalescent model (<code>log-PG</code>) and the log-likelihood of the sequence data on the gene tree (<code>log-L</code>). Check that the acceptance proportions are in a reasonable range (about 20% to 40% for continuous parameters such as \\(\\theta\\)). If you need to terminate the program before it finishes, you can do so using the key combination <code>Ctrl-C</code> (e.g., hold down the Control key and then press the C key). The final screen output, printed after the MCMC is completed, summarizes the posterior parameter estimates for \\(\\theta\\) (<code>theta_1H</code>) in the second column. The posterior mean in the first row, for example, is \\(0.000352\\) and the lower and upper limits of the highest posterior density (HPD) set of values are in rows 8 and 9, respectively.

If there are many populations/species only the first few \\(\\tau\\)s will be printed to screen but all the \\(\\tau\\)s will be available in the summary created at the end of the run (see below). When the run finishes, a final block is written summarizing the results. The first two rows give the mean and median of the posterior distribution for each parameter. This is followed by summaries of the statistical uncertainty: the standard deviation (S.D.) of the posterior distribution; the minimum (min) and maximum (max) values; the lower and upper bounds of the 95% Credible Interval (2.5% and 97.5%); the lower and upper bounds of the Highest Posterior Density (HPD) Interval (2.5%HPD and 97.5%HPD); the Effective Sample Size (ESS*); and the Efficiency (Eff*). Larger values for ESS* and Eff* indicate better mixing and more reliable estimates. The above information is also printed (along with other technical details of the run) to the output file specified by the <code>jobname</code> variable in the control file (in our example, <code>jobname = out</code> and thus the output file is called <code>out.txt</code>).

Columns 2 to 6 are the five acceptance proportions for the conventional MCMC moves, as discussed above.  Columns 7 and 8 are the acceptance proportions for moves that change the species tree topology, both are much lower than the other parameter proposals, this is typical and it is often not possible to improve these acceptance proportions.  Columns 9 and 10 are posterior means of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau\\) for the root population (-1 is printed in column 9 if \\(\\theta\\)s are integrated out). The last two numbers are the log MSC gene-tree density (Rannala and Yang 2003) and the average log sequence likelihood (Felsenstein 1981).</p> <p>Next, there are 4 sections: A, B, C and D summarizing the results. Section (A) lists the species trees in decreasing order of posterior probabilities. From this you can easily identify the 95% or 99% credibility set of species trees. Section (B) lists the splits (or bipartitions) and their posterior probabilities. The splits here take into account the location of the root, and may be different from the splits for unrooted trees. Section (C) prints the majority-rule consensus tree, with posterior probabilities for nodes.</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#mcmc-output-file_1","title":"MCMC output file","text":"<p>The MCMC sample of species trees is collected in the file out.mcmc.txt.

After the chain has started, columns 2-6 give the acceptance proportions for the conventional MCMC moves discussed above while column 7 (rj) now shows the acceptance proportion for reversible jump proposals (collapsing  or expanding species delimitations on the guide tree). In general the larger this proportion, the more efficient the rjMCMC algorithm is. However there is no optimal acceptance proportion for the rjMCMC move, and a value close to 0 may not necessarily mean a problem. If one model has posterior probability close to 1, the acceptance proportion should be near 0 as well. Thus both poor mixing of the rjMCMC algorithm and extreme posterior model probabilities can cause the acceptance proportion for the rjMCMC to be close to 0. It has been noted that if the rjMCMC algorithm is suffering from poor mixing, different starting species trees often lead to different results. Next there are three numbers related to the rjMCMC move.  The rest of the line shows the posterior means for \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\tau_0\\) of the root ancestral population (which exist in all species-tree or species delimitation models), the current log MSC density and average log sequence likelihood. The three numbers  in columns 8-10 that are related to the rjMCMC move, for example, <pre><code>10 111 P[5]=0.9895\n</code></pre> represent the number of parameters in the current model (np), in this case 10, the species delimitation, in this case 111, and the current posterior probability of the most probable delimitation P[5]=0.9895.

The automatic adjustment of the finetune variable (MCMC step lengths) appears to be reliable and is recommended. However, be sure to check that the resulting acceptance proportions are neither too small nor too large. Here we provide some guidance for manual adjustments of the step lengths. A good strategy is to use automatic adjustments initially to generate good step lengths and then copy the step lengths into the control file, while continuing to use automatic adjustment; that way the next time the control file is run the  automatic adjustment procedure will start with near-optimal step lengths and less optimization will therefore be required.</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#adjusting-the-step-lengths-manually-finetune-0","title":"Adjusting the step lengths manually (finetune = 0)","text":"<p>First note the following line found in the control file <code>yu2001.bpp.ctl</code>. Here finetune = 1 means that MCMC step lengths will be adjusted automatically, and the specified values are used as initial values. <pre><code>    finetune = 1\n</code></pre> There are seven finetune steplengths here. They are in a fixed order and always read by the program even if the concerned proposal is not used. The first five of them are \\(\\epsilon_1\\), \\(\\epsilon_2\\), \\(\\epsilon_3\\), \\(\\epsilon_4\\), and \\(\\epsilon_5\\), described in  (Rannala and Yang 2003). These are the step lengths used in the MCMC proposals that (1) change internal node ages in the gene tree, (2) prune and re-graft nodes in the gene tree (SPR), (3) update \\(\\theta\\), (4) update \\(\\tau\\)s using the rubber-band algorithm, and (5) implements the mixing step. The 6th and 7th are for the proposals that change the locus rates or heredity multipliers and that change the sequencing errors, respectively. If the model assumes the same rate for all loci and does not use heredity multipliers, the 6th proposal step is not used. If the model assumes no sequencing errors, the 7th step is not used. The acceptance proportions for the first five proposals are always printed out on the screen, but those for the 6th and 7th are printed out only if the concerned proposal is used in the model. In the example above, only the first five proposals are used in the algorithm and we will manually change the step lengths so that the acceptance proportions become close to 30%.  First, edit the line, changing it to: <pre><code>    finetune = 0\n</code></pre> The basic strategy for adjusting fine-tune parameters is if the acceptance proportion is too small (e.g., \\(&lt;0.10\\)), decrease the corresponding finetune parameter. If the acceptance proportion is too large (e.g., \\(&gt;0.80\\)), increase the finetune parameter. Run the program for a small number of iterations and look at the screen output to examine the acceptance proportions: <pre><code>   0%  0.71 0.19 0.34 0.00 0.41   0.0004    463.81031  -12720.98567  0:04\n   5%  0.72 0.19 0.32 0.00 0.41   0.0003    458.65988  -12720.53426  0:04\n  10%  0.72 0.19 0.34 0.00 0.42   0.0004    454.99289  -12720.66361  0:05\n  15%  0.72 0.19 0.34 0.00 0.41   0.0004    481.20520  -12720.78839  0:06\n</code></pre> Here the first acceptance proportion, at 0.72, appears too large, which means that the corresponding finetune parameter (2 in the control file) is too small, similarly the second acceptance proportion, at 0.19, appears  too small, which means that the corresponding finetune parameter is too large.  Terminate the run (Ctrl-C) and edit the finetune values in the control file and then run the program again, checking the acceptance rates.  Repeat this process a few times until every acceptance proportion is neither too small nor too large. In this example, changing the second finetune parameter (SPR) from \\(0.00001\\) to  \\(0.000003\\) brings the acceptance proportion to about \\(0.30\\), namely: <pre><code>  10%  0.71 0.31 0.34 0.00 0.30   0.0004    447.59035  -12721.04474  0:06\n  15%  0.71 0.30 0.33 0.00 0.30   0.0004    487.91342  -12720.96697  0:07\n  20%  0.71 0.30 0.32 0.00 0.30   0.0003    430.67545  -12720.83600  0:08\n</code></pre> However, increasing the first finetune parameter (even by an order of magnitude to 20) has little effect. Sometimes it will not be possible to reduce the acceptance proportion for a parameter, as in this case (even using automatic adjustment produces an acceptance proportion of about \\(0.71\\) in this case).</p> <p>The MCMC proposals discussed above are used in all four analyses (A00, A01, A10, A11), so that the description here applies to all of them. Note that the finetune parameters affect the efficiency of the MCMC or how fast one can obtain reliable results. In theory they do not change the results if runs using different finetune parameters (with potentially different acceptance proportions) are all run for long enough to generate reliable results.</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#simulating-gene-trees-and-alignments-using-bpp","title":"Simulating Gene Trees and Alignments Using BPP","text":"<p>The <code>--simulate</code> option of BPP4 replaces the earlier MCCOAL program distributed with BPP versions 3.4 and earlier.

In this example, 100 loci, each of 1000 sites, will be simulated.</p> <p>species&amp;tree This block specifies the number and names of species, the species tree, and the parameters under the multispecies coalescent model, including the species divergence times (\\(\\tau\\)s) and population size parameters (\\(\\theta = 4N\\mu\\)). For the example above, 100 loci, each of 1000 sites, will be simulated, on the species tree ((A, B), (C, D)),  with 3, 2, 1, 1 sequences for A, B, C, D, so that there are 7 sequences at each locus. The divergence time parameters (\\(\\tau\\)s) are after <code>:</code> in the tree, while the population size parameters (\\(\\theta\\)s) are after <code>#</code>. Thus we have 0.01 for all \\(\\theta\\)s, and \\(\\tau_{ABCD} = 0.012\\), \\(\\tau_{AB} = 0.01\\), and \\(\\tau_{CD} = 0.011\\). We need \\(\\theta_A\\) and \\(\\theta_B\\) because 2 or more sequences are sampled from species A and B. Parameters \\(\\theta_C\\) and \\(\\theta_D\\) are unnecessary in this case as only one sequence is sampled from C and D: if you specify them, they will be ignored by the program. Note that both \\(\\theta\\)s and \\(\\tau\\)s are measured by the expected number of mutations per site, so that \\(\\theta = 0.01\\) means that two sequences sampled from the population are 1% different. For reference, the estimate for the human species is \\(\\theta_H = 0.0006\\).</p> <p>model This variable can take two possible values: 0 for JC69 and 7 for GTR. The next few lines are relevant for the GTR model.</p> <p>Qrates This variable specifies the exchangeability parameters in the GTR model (\\(a, b, c, d, e, f\\) for TC, TA, TG, CA, CG, and AG, in Yang 1994). There are two options, either to have those rates fixed for all loci or to have them sampled at random. The first has the following format (note that the first 0-1 number is a switch):</p> <pre><code>Qrates = 1  2 1 1 1 1 2   *  1: fixed; for TC TA TG CA CG AG\n</code></pre> <p>The input is one integer value (0 or 1) which acts as a switch followed by six real numbers. The line above fixes the rates at \\(a = 2, b = c = d = e = 1\\) and \\(f = 2\\), so that the transition rate is twice as high as the transversion rate, and the model corresponds to K80 or HKY. Note that only the relative rates matter, because the rate matrix (\\(Q\\)) is scaled so that the average rate (over the base frequencies) is 1 and branch lengths are measured in the expected number of mutations/substitutions per site. Nevertheless the program expects six rate parameters in the input here:</p> <pre><code>Qrates = 0  10 5 5 5 5 10   *  0: dirichlet, for TC TA TG CA CG AG\n</code></pre> <p>The second option, above, is to sample \\(a, b, c, d, e\\) from the Dirichlet distribution for every locus. The above specifies Dir(10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10), with parameters \\(\\alpha_a = 10, \\alpha_b = \\alpha_c = \\alpha_d = \\alpha_e = 10\\), and \\(\\alpha_f = 10\\). The rates generated from the Dirichlet sum to 1, and they are rescaled. Note that larger values for those parameters mean less variance, while the mean for \\(a\\), say, is given by \\(\\alpha_a/\\alpha\\) with \\(\\alpha = \\alpha_a + \\alpha_b + \\alpha_c + \\alpha_d + \\alpha_e + \\alpha_f\\). The specification here gives on average a transition/transversion rate ratio of 2 (if the base frequencies are fixed at \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) each), but it varies among loci.</p> <p>basefreqs The base frequency parameters (\\(\\pi_T, \\pi_C, \\pi_A, \\pi_G\\)) can also be fixed or sampled from the Dirichlet distribution, like the <code>Qrates</code>. The two options are as follows: <pre><code>    basefreqs = 1 0.15 0.35 0.15 0.35  * 1: fixed; Base frequencies are for TCAG.\n    basefreqs = 0  10  10 10  10       * 0: random, Dirichlet(aT, aC, aA, aG), for base frequencies\n</code></pre></p> <p>alpha_siterate The gamma shape parameter (\\(\\alpha\\)) for rate variation among sites of the same locus can be fixed or sampled from a gamma distribution. The possible options are as follows. When alpha is fixed, the same value is used for all loci. Otherwise different \\(\\alpha\\)s are used for different loci. Note that given alpha, the rates for sites at the same locus have a G((\\(\\alpha, \\alpha\\)) distribution with mean 1 [@Yang1993; @Yang1994]. The fourth option below will allow the program to sample \\(\\alpha\\) from \\(G(100, 20)\\), with mean 5, for each locus and then use \\(G(\\alpha, \\alpha)\\) to describe the among-site rate variation for the locus: <pre><code>    alpha_siterate = 1 0            * 1: alpha fixed at 0(inf), one rate for all sites at the locus\n    alpha_siterate = 1  5.6 0       * 1: alpha fixed at 5.6, K = 0(inf) for continuous gamma\n    alpha_siterate = 1  5.6 5       * 1: alpha fixed at 5.6, K = 5 categories for discrete gamma\n    alpha_siterate = 0  100  20  5  * 0: alpha sampled from G(100, 20), with mean 5, K = 5 for discrete gamma\n</code></pre></p> <p>The variables <code>locusrate</code> and <code>clock</code> are used to specify relaxed-clock models, with rate variation among branches and among loci. These are the same models as implemented in the inference program. Please see Models of Substitution Rate Variation for details.</p> <p>locusrate This specifies variable rates for different loci. The default is 0, meaning that all loci have the same rate. To specify variable rates for loci, use the following format: <pre><code>    locusrate = 0 (default)\n    locusrate = mu_bar a_mui prior\n    locusrate = mu_bar a_mui\n    locusrate = 1.0 5.0 dir\n</code></pre> Here <code>mu_bar</code> is the mean rate across loci. If <code>prior = dir</code> (gamma-Dirichlet), the total rate (\\(L\\bar\\mu\\)) is partitioned to generate the locus-rates (\\(\\mu_i\\)) according to the Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter \\(\\alpha\\) (<code>a_mui</code>). Large \\(\\alpha\\) (10 or 100, say) means that the rates are similar among loci, while small values (1 or 0.5, say) mean that rates are highly variable among loci. If <code>prior = iid</code> (conditional i.i.d.), the locus rates (\\(\\mu_i\\)) are i.i.d. given the mean rate (\\(\\bar\\mu\\)): <pre><code>    mu_i ~ Gamma(a_mui, a_mui/mubar)\n</code></pre></p> <p>clock This variable is used to specify strict-clock or relaxed-clock models. The default is <code>clock = 1</code> for strict clock, while <code>clock = 2</code> is the independents-rates model, and <code>clock = 3</code> is the correlated-rates model (which is implemented for the MSC model with no introgression and is unavailable for the MSC-I model). <pre><code>    clock = 1 (default: strict clock)\n    clock = 2 v_bar a_vi prior dist  * independent-rates model\n    clock = 2 0.1 10 dir G    * gamma-dirichlet for loci &amp; gamma for branches\n    clock = 2 0.1 10 iid LN   * iid for loci &amp; log-normal for branches\n    clock = 3 v_bar a_vi prior dist  * correlated-rates model\n    clock = 3 0.1 10 iid G    * iid for loci &amp; gamma for branches\n    clock = 3 0.1 10 iid LN   * iid for loci &amp; log-normal for branches\n</code></pre> The specification (<code>clock = 2 0.1 10 dir G</code>) means the following. First the average variance parameter is = 0.1. Then the total \\(L\\bar\\mu\\) is partitioned into \\(\\mu_i\\) (for \\(i = 1, 2, \\cdots, L\\)) according to the Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter \\(\\alpha = 10\\) (<code>a_vi</code>). In contrast, the specification (<code>clock = 2 0.1 10 iid LN</code>) means that the variance parameter for locus \\(\\nu_i\\) is generated as \\(\\nu_i|\\bar\\nu \\sim G(\\alpha, \\alpha/\\bar\\nu)\\) with shape parameter \\(\\alpha = 10\\) (<code>a_vi</code>) and mean \\(\\bar\\nu = 0.1\\). In both prior models (<code>prior=dir</code> and <code>iid</code>), \\(\\alpha\\) (<code>a_vi</code>) is inversely related to the variance in \\(\\mu_i\\) among loci: use small values of \\(\\alpha\\) (2, 1, or 0.5) if the clock nearly holds at some loci but is seriously violated at others, and large values (such as 10 or 100) if the clock is violated in the same extent at different loci.</p> <p><code>clock = 2</code> Given the locus rate \\(\\mu_i\\) (specified using the <code>locusrate</code> variable) and the variance parameter \\(\\nu_i\\) (specified using the <code>clock</code> variable) for locus \\(i\\), the rates for species-tree branches are specified as follows. If <code>dist = G</code> (for gamma), the rate for branch \\(j\\) at locus \\(i\\) has the following gamma distribution with mean \\(\\mu_i\\) and variance \\(\\nu_i\\)</p> <p>\\(r_{ij} | \\mu_i, \\nu_i \\sim G(\\mu_i^2/\\nu_i, \\mu_i/\\nu_i).\\)</p> <p>If <code>dist = LN</code> (for log-normal), the rate has the log-normal distribution </p> <p>\\(r_{ij} | \\mu_i, \\nu_i \\sim LN(\\mu_i, \\nu_i).\\)</p> <p><code>clock = 3</code> The correlated-rates model is specified similarly, and for the MSC model only. Given the locus rate \\(\\mu_i\\) (specified using the <code>locusrate</code> variable) and the variance parameter \\(\\nu_i\\) (specified using the <code>clock</code> variable) for locus \\(i\\), the rates for species-tree branches are specified recursively, starting from the root towards the tips. If <code>dist = G</code> (for gamma), the rate for branch \\(j\\) at locus \\(i\\) has the following gamma distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha = \\mu_i^2/\\nu_i\\) and with the mean to be the rate for the parental branch of \\(j\\) or \\(r_{i,p(j)}\\):</p> <p>\\(r_{ij} | \\mu_i, \\nu_i, r_{i,p(j)} \\sim G(\\frac{\\mu_i^2}{\\nu_i}, \\frac{\\mu_i^2}{\\nu_i r_{i,p(j)}}).\\)</p> <p>If <code>dist = LN</code> (for log-normal), the rate for branch \\(j\\) at locus \\(i\\) has the log-normal distribution with the mean to be the parental rate and variance parameter \\(\\nu_i\\):</p> <p>\\(r_{ij} | \\nu_i, r_{i,p(j)} \\sim LN(r_{i,p(j)}, \\nu_i).\\)</p> <p>After the rates for branches (populations) on the species tree are generated for the locus, they are used to calculate the gene-tree branch lengths. Gene-tree branches residing in the same species/populations have the same rate (the rate of that species at the locus), while those residing in different species may have different rates. A branch on a gene tree may have segments residing in different species/populations, and the length of the branch (measured by the expected number of mutations/substitutions per site) is calculated by adding up those segments.</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#program-output","title":"Program output","text":"<p>Running the program on the above control file produces the following screen output, indicating that the simulation has been successful: <pre><code>bpp --simulate MCcoal.ctl \nSite rates: alpha sampled from Gamma(100.000000,20.000000), K = 5\nbpp v4.7.0_linux_x86_64, 15GB RAM, 8 cores\nhttps://github.com/bpp/bpp\n\nDetected CPU features: mmx sse sse2 sse3 ssse3 sse4.1 sse4.2 popcnt avx avx2\nAuto-selected SIMD ISA: AVX2\n\nSubstitution model: GTR with generated rates from Dirichlet\n                    10.000000 5.000000 5.000000 5.000000 5.000000 10.000000\nBase frequencies: generated from Dirichlet\n                  a_T=10.000000 a_C=10.000000 a_A=10.000000 a_G=10.000000\n4 species: A (3) B (2) C (1) D (1)\n  ((A #0.010000: 0.010000, B #0.010000: 0.010000) #0.010000: 0.002000, (C: 0.011000, D: 0.011000) #0.010000: 0.001000) #0.010000;\n\nMap of populations and ancestors (1 in map indicates ancestor):\n  Species   1  2  3  4  5  6  7\n1 A         1  0  0  0  1  1  0  tau = 0.000000  theta = 0.010000\n2 B         0  1  0  0  1  1  0  tau = 0.000000  theta = 0.010000\n3 C         0  0  1  0  1  0  1  tau = 0.000000  theta = 0.000000\n4 D         0  0  0  1  1  0  1  tau = 0.000000  theta = 0.000000\n5 ABCD      0  0  0  0  1  0  0  tau = 0.012000  theta = 0.010000\n6 AB        0  0  0  0  1  1  0  tau = 0.010000  theta = 0.010000\n7 CD        0  0  0  0  1  0  1  tau = 0.011000  theta = 0.010000\n\nSequence data file -&gt; MySeq.txt\nTrees -&gt; MyTree.tre\nModel parameters for loci -&gt; modelparas.txt\nTags to species mapping (Imap) -&gt; MyImap.txt\n</code></pre> Several output files are produced.

The simulator uses dates in units of expected substitutions, but the inference program uses dates in calendar time such as years or thousand years. The dates in the <code>seqDates</code> file can be converted to a unit of years by dividing by the per year substition rate. This is required to use the simulator to generate data to use in the inference program. For example, if we assume a substitution rate of \\(10^{\u22128}\\) per year and use the same example as above, the <code>datefile</code> to use for inference would be <pre><code>A^a1 5000\nA^a2 5000\nA^a3 6000\nA^a4 6000\nB^b1 0\nB^b2 0\nB^b3 0 \nB^b4 7000\nC^c1 0 \nC^c2 0 \n</code></pre> BPP does not generate a file with the dates in years or similar units. The user must prepare this file after running the simulator.</p>"},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#advanced-features-of-bpp","title":"Advanced Features of BPP","text":""},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#threading-and-checkpointing","title":"Threading and Checkpointing","text":""},{"location":"bpp-4-manual/#threads","title":"Threads","text":"<p>BPP4 can use Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) instruction sets (also called vector instructions) available on modern processors. It automatically detects and uses the best instruction set available so you don't have to do anything about this. However, you can manually specify and force an instruction set in the control file using the arch tag. For instance, arch=SSE forces BPP to use the SSE instruction set even if AVX (which has twice the register size of SSE and thus in theory yields twice the speedup) is present on the system. To completely disable vector instruction, one can use the arch=CPU option. The available values for the arch tag are 'CPU', 'SSE', 'AVX', 'AVX2' and 'NEON'.</p> <p></p> <p>Modern computer architecture using Non-Uniform momery access (NUMA).</p> <p>BPP4 can use multiple cores/threads. The control variable threads has the following syntax. <pre><code>    Threads = 8 19 1\n</code></pre> This means BPP will use 8 threads, starting from core/thread 19, with increment 1; in other words hardware threads 19-36 will be used. The software threads are pinned onto the hardware threads and they not allowed to migrate. We found that this helps with performance.</p> <p>Modern clusters based on microprocessors use a common shared-memory configuration called NUMA (for non-uniform memory access). The cluster typically consists of two or four microprocessors interconnected on a local bus to a shared memory on a single motherboard.</p> <p>You can use commands like <code>lscpu</code> to see the machine architecture. For example, on our server lscpu gives the following output: <pre><code>    Architecture:          x86_64\n    CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\n    Byte Order:            Little Endian\n    CPU(s):                144\n    On-line CPU(s) list:   0-143\n    Thread(s) per core:    2\n    Core(s) per socket:    18\n    Socket(s):             4\n    NUMA node(s):          4\n    ...\n    NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-17,72-89\n    NUMA node1 CPU(s):     18-35,90-107\n    NUMA node2 CPU(s):     36-53,108-125\n    NUMA node3 CPU(s):     54-71,126-143\n</code></pre> This means that hardware threads 1-18 are on CPU0, while threads 73-90 are the hyperthreads on CPU0. The specification Threads = 8 19 1 thus uses 8 threads on CPU1. Our recommendation is that you do some tests yourself using threads = 2 or 4 or 8, and use options that work well for your servers. Adjust the step lengths first. Then use burnin=0 and a small nsample so that the running time is about 1-2 minutes. Change threads and record running time.</p> <p>Make sure all threads for the same BPP job are on the same CPU.
